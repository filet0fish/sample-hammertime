Stop! Hammer Time
=================

A sample project for a talk on HammerJS

Project built with Yeoman as follows:

```
yo webapp
bower install hammerjs -save
grunt serve
```

Step 3 makes it work. We check the swipe direction, call the carousel's next/prev methods.

* Note possible improvements such as drag support
* Discuss css positioning, animation, and gpu rendering
