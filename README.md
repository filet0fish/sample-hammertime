Stop! Hammer Time
=================

A sample project for a talk on HammerJS

Project built with Yeoman as follows:

```
yo webapp
bower install hammerjs -save
grunt serve
```

Master branch doesn't do anything touch, it is straight out of the box bootstrap html/js/css. Nothing fancy other than what yeoman builds automatically.
