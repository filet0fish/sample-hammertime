Stop! Hammer Time
=================

A sample project for a talk on HammerJS

Project built with Yeoman as follows:

```
yo webapp
bower install hammerjs -save
grunt serve
```

Step 2 passes in options to Hammer to optimize performance for our application.  We disable gestures we are not interested in and tweak the swipe values to pick up slower, drag like swipes.

* Note where to find options: https://github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js/wiki/Getting-Started#wiki-gesture-options
